# Number-Guessing-Game

While coding for this Number Guessing Game, mostly practiced 
- "if-else" statement to check whether the number is correctly guessed or not; to check for no more tries left.
- "for-loop" to generate 5 tries and letting user to guess at most 5 times.

The new things I have learned here is - 
- to create a separate function or method and to call that methode from the 'main' method.
- and also to generate random numbers.
